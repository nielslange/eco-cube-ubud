# Homestay Ubud

**tl;dr:** This project describes the building of our homestay in Ubud in user stories. 

## Target group

Digital nomads, between 25 and 45, with an annual income above USD 50k that want to explore Asia while not giving up the comforts they're used from home.

## Intention

Create a bungalow that is sustainable, comfortable and luxury as much as possible. The guest can focus on their work while being surrounded by the breathtaking Balinese nature, knowing that they cause minimal harm to the environment.

## Roles

- Host: The person that owns the house
